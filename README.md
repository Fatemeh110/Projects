# Decision Tree Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a custom **Decision Tree** algorithm from scratch. It includes multiple datasets and code examples showcasing its functionality and accuracy.

## Features
- Custom implementation of Decision Tree for classification.
- Supports parameter tuning for better performance.
- Multiple datasets for testing and evaluation.

## Datasets
The `datasets/` folder contains the following files:
- `titanic.csv`: Titanic survival dataset.
- `spam.csv`: Spam classification dataset.
  


DecisionTree | 
For titanic to give 78.78% accuracy you should change
the params to :
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
 dataset = "titanic"
 #dataset = "spam"
 params = {
 "max_depth": 5,
 "min_samples_leaf": 40,
 "criterion": "entropy",
 }
 N = 10
```

For spam to give 80.20% accuracy you should change the
params to:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
 #dataset = "titanic"
 dataset = "spam"
 params = {
 "max_depth": 5,
 "min_samples_leaf": 40,
 "criterion": "entropy",
 }
 N = 20
 ```
